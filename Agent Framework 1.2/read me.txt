Please note, this is a rough implementation with the following changes:

The PerceptionSystem and MemorySystem now store inputs and memories as dictionaries containing a type and value. This will allow us to handle different types of inputs and memories, and will make it easier to implement retrieval methods that handle different types of memories.
The MemorySystem now stores past actions in a new deque, past_actions.
The MemorySystem now stores relationships as a dictionary of dictionaries. This will allow us to store complex information about relationships.
The AgentManager now includes a method to observe an agent's current state, including its last reflection.
The AgentManager now includes a method to intervene in an agent's behavior by changing its attributes.
The Agent class now includes a method to execute the next action based on a decision from the CognitiveControlSystem.
