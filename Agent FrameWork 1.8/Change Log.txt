Here's the change log for the code modifications:

1. Added new class `ContextSystem` to help with contextualizing input. The system has been incorporated into `PerceptionSystem`.

2. Added new class `SpeechSystem` to generate speech based on the decisions made by the agent. It's incorporated into the `CognitiveControlSystem` and `Agent` class.

3. Added new class `ExperienceSystem` for storing and retrieving experiences. This system is added to the `Agent` class and a new method `gain_experience` is added to the `Agent` class for storing experiences.

4. Added new class `SkillAcquisitionSystem` for acquiring and using skills. It's added to the `Agent` class and two new methods `learn_skill` and `use_skill` are added to the `Agent` class.

5. Modified `PerceptionSystem` to incorporate `ContextSystem` for contextualizing input.

6. Modified `CognitiveControlSystem` to incorporate `SpeechSystem` for generating speech based on decisions.

7. Modified `Agent` class to incorporate `SpeechSystem`, `ExperienceSystem`, and `SkillAcquisitionSystem`. Also, added new methods for gaining experience and learning skills.

The order of the classes are now as follows:

- `LanguageModelAPI`
- `AgentIdentity`
- `ContextSystem`
- `SpeechSystem`
- `ExperienceSystem`
- `SkillAcquisitionSystem`
- `PerceptionSystem`
- `MemorySystem`
- `EmotionalSystem`
- `MotivationalSystem`
- `ReasoningSystem`
- `CommunicationSystem`
- `CognitiveControlSystem`
- `Agent`

This order helps maintain dependencies between classes, ensuring that any class that depends on another class is defined after the class it depends on.
