For creating a world simulation for your agents, it depends on the type of world you want to create. You may want to consider creating classes for different types of environments or situations your agents can interact with. These could represent different locations, objects, other agents, or any other aspects of the world that are relevant to your agents. The agents could then interact with these classes through their Perception and Action systems. For example, an agent could perceive changes in its environment, store those changes in its Memory system, and then decide on an action to take based on its Reasoning system. The result of the action could then alter the environment, and the cycle continues. This kind of simulation would require careful design of how the agents and environment interact, and how changes in the environment are represented and perceived by the agents.
