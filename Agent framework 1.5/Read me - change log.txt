This version of the code includes:

An expanded AgentIdentity class to include occupation and relationships, reflecting various aspects of its inner mind.
A new observe_environment method in the PerceptionSystem class to observe the environment.
New store_environment and retrieve_environment methods in the MemorySystem class to store and retrieve the state of the environment.
A new plan_exploration method in the ReasoningSystem class to plan exploration of the environment.
An updated decide_next_action method in the CognitiveControlSystem class to handle fast mode operation.
A potential_actions attribute in the Agent class to store potential actions that the agent can execute.
An updated perceive_act_cycle method in the Agent class to handle both interactive and fast mode operations.
An updated execute_plan method in the Agent class to only execute actions that are in the agent's list of potential actions.
An updated create_agent method in the AgentManager class to accept potential actions as a parameter when creating a new agent.
These updates should help to align the system more closely with the concepts and methods described in the Voyager and Generative Agents papers. Please note that the code snippets marked with "This method needs to be implemented..." require further specific implementation details based on the particular requirements of the system. Also, some aspects like the Skill Library, Iterative Prompting and Self-improvement, and advanced Inter-Agent Communication are complex and would require substantial time and effort to implement.

expanded emotional system
---------------------------

to implement the above improvements, here are some suggestions for modifications to the existing classes and the creation of new ones:

Expand EmotionalSystem: Create additional attributes for the EmotionalSystem to capture more nuanced emotions. This could include a mood attribute to track the agent's baseline mood, a history attribute to track the agent's emotional tendencies over time, and a personality attribute to reflect the agent's inherent emotional disposition.

Add Sentiment Analysis: Implement a method in the PerceptionSystem to use NLP techniques to interpret the sentiment of text received by the agent. This sentiment can then be used to inform the agent's emotional state.

Emotion Expression: Implement a method in the Agent class that modifies the agent's responses based on its emotional state. This could involve selecting words or phrases that align with the agent's current emotion, or adjusting the tone or punctuation of the agent's responses.

Emotional Resonance: In the EmotionalSystem, add a method that adjusts the agent's emotional state based on the emotions perceived in received messages. This could involve increasing the intensity of the agent's current emotion if the perceived emotion matches, or triggering a change in emotion if a strong emotion is perceived.

Emotional Memories: Extend the MemorySystem to store emotional impressions and memories. This could involve adding a new method for storing these impressions and a method for retrieving emotional memories or impressions based on current context or emotional state.

Emotion Regulation: Add a method in the EmotionalSystem for self-reflection and emotion regulation. This method could involve logic for decreasing the intensity of negative emotions over time, or for adjusting the agent's emotional state based on its goals or desired state.

Discuss Emotions: Implement a method in the Agent class for discussing emotions and providing emotional support. This could involve recognizing prompts for emotional discussion in received text and generating responses that validate, empathize with, or offer support for the expressed emotions.

Reinforcement Learning: Develop a new system or class for reinforcement learning. This could involve defining rewards for successful emotional interactions and adjusting the agent's behavior over time based on these rewards.

Advanced Emotional Models: Consider incorporating more advanced models for representing and processing emotions. This could involve neural networks or other machine learning techniques, and would likely involve significant additions or changes to the EmotionalSystem.

Emotion Embeddings: Implement a method for creating embeddings of emotional states or moods. These embeddings could be used by the MemorySystem to retrieve relevant memories based on the agent's current emotional state.

Let's modify the classes to incorporate these changes. Please note that the specifics of implementing some of these features, such as neural networks for emotions or reinforcement learning, are beyond the scope of this example and would require additional libraries and significant development effort.

Personalized Agents Interaction System
-----------------
15. **Personalized Agents Interaction System**: Adapts the agent's behavior, responses, and strategies to align with individual Agents characteristics, preferences, and interaction history. It includes the Agent Profile Module, Adaptive Communication Style Module, User Experience Customization Module, Interaction Memory and Analysis Module, and Agent Feedback Integration Module. In this case the agents can either be humans or other Digital Agents.
------------------------------------------------

To incorporate the Personalized Agents Interaction System, we can add the following components to the existing Agent class:

Agent Profile Module: This can be achieved by expanding the AgentIdentity class to store the agent's characteristics and preferences.

Adaptive Communication Style Module: We can add methods to the Agent class that adjust its communication style based on the history of interactions with other agents or users.

User Experience Customization Module: This may include additional attributes or methods in the Agent class that can be set to customize the user's experience.

Interaction Memory and Analysis Module: We can use the MemorySystem class to store and retrieve past interactions, and add methods to the Agent class to analyze these interactions.

Agent Feedback Integration Module: We can add methods to the Agent class that allow it to receive feedback from users or other agents, adjust its behavior accordingly, and store this feedback in its memory.

Here's how the code might look after these modifications:
